## UX

### The Strategy Plane

**Why are we so special?**

'Lulu loves' boasts products that are 100% vegan, cruelty-free, paraben free and handmade. 
We are focused on offering pamper products to tweens and teens, aged 11-19. 
The LL community centres around the promotion of positive mental health and resilience in teens. 
Both through our online platform and notes that accompany our products, 
teens can learn easily digestible techniques relating to mental health and wellness. 
So, whether it's a mini meditation, breathing exercise or the latest ASMR video, 
we want you to kick back and take 5; Self-care isn't selfish!

**Who else is building this?**

[Lush Cosmetics](https://uk.lush.com/) offer a similar service. They are also a handmade beauty business, focused on ethical and sustainable products and offer a large choice of bath bomb designs. 
They do a good job of communicating the company's values on their homepage, along with beautifully tactile photography to showcase their products. 
However, based on some products they stock, anti-ageing creams etc. it is possible to surmise that their demographic begins slightly older and spans a greater range than the LL user. 
LL's brand and online presence should be tailored more specifically to the target demographic. 

![Lush Homepage](/assets/images/lush-home-page.jpg)

The Lush cosmetics menu offers over 80 items in its drop-down menu which could be overwhelming and cause decision fatigue in tweens and teens. 

![Lush Menu](/assets/images/lush-menu.jpg)

An [article published on rte.ie](https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2020/1023/1173492-google-search-for-shop-local-ireland-up-540/) in October 2020, 
reported that search terms such as "shop local Ireland" saw an increase of 540%. 
As Lush is a UK based brand it would be beneficial for LL to communicate clearly to guardians and teens that it is an Irish brand.

**What are the tech and other considerations?**

The LL demographic are tech savvy. [The Irish Times reports](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/children-spend-equivalent-of-61-days-a-year-online-study-1.4012928)
that 15% of 12-year-olds spend the equivalent of 61 days a year online. 
Based on a 2019 [survey](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-isshh/informationsocietystatistics-households2019/frequencyofinternetusage/) from the Central Statistics Office, 
an estimated 88% of individuals in Ireland access the internet through a mobile device. 
With this in mind, there should be a mobile first approach to design and functionality.
This product is for general consumers. As this is a B2C product, it should focus heavily on branding and emotive product images.

**Project roadmap**

To determine the business objectives and user needs for this release I have created the table below. 
Each opportunity/problem is rated on a scale of 1 - 5 in two dimensions; Importance and Feasibility.

Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Feasibility
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Create an online presence | 5 | 5
Increase social media followers | 1 | 2
Sell products online | 5 | 1
Customisable gift boxes | 1 | 1
Start the LL blog | 4 | 4
Showcase a product | 5 | 4
Generate interest in the brand and build a relationship with users | 5 | 5

### The Scope Plane

#### Feature Scope

To establish the feature scope for this project I am using the agile methodology, I have made a list of all possible features and given each one a difficulty rating between 1 and 3.
Each release will allow for a maximum of 12 points. The table below will be used to determine which features to prioritise and which to schedule for a later release.

Feature | Rating
------------ | -------------
Announcement bar at the top of the home page to highlight relevant information e.g. sale or newsletter promotion | 1
Logo that links to the home page so users can orientate themselves easily | 1
Clear, consistent navigation on each page | 1
Showcase products with a sliding banner | 2
Highlight aspects of the brand that are important to the user (e.g cruelty-free products, customer service) using short messages and icons | 1
Self Care Club blog, featuring articles and videos on products as well as general tips relating to self care | 1
Online shop that will give users the option to set up an account or check out as guest and pay securely using Paypal, Stripe or Apple Pay | 3
Related products section for upselling and cross selling | 3
Customisable gift box product | 3
Calculated shipping | 3
A carousel of brand logos to showcase products that have been awarded, featured or commended | 1
Newsletter sign-up | 2
Footer which includes links to social media accounts and a footer menu of FAQ and Privacy Policy | 1
Contact form | 2
Customer service chat feature | 3
Search bar | 2
Custom mouse icon | 1

Given limited resources, the features that offer the most value at this stage are:
- Logo that links to the home page
- Clear, consistent navigation on each page
- Showcase products with a sliding banner
- Highlight aspects of the brand that are important to the user
- Self Care Club blog (first article)
- Newsletter sign-up
- Footer
- Contact form
- Custom mouse icon

These features solve the problem of generating interest and anticipation around the shop launch and beginning the process of establising the brand with potential customers.

### The Structure Plane

As the site will not have a lot of content to begin with a linear narrative will work best

All forms on the site will provide feedback to show if they have been successful
The site will include a custom 404 error page

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
